# Low-level Programming

In this section, I learnt about the C Programming Language which is a general-purpose computer programming language. It is also a low level and compiled
programming language. I was taken through the following concepts to help me understand the hatching out, data structures, and algorithms of the language.

- **Hello, World**
- **Variables, if, else, while and for loops**
- **Functions, nested loops**
- **Debugging**
- **More Functions, nested loops**
- **Pointers, arrays and strings**
- **More Pointers, arrays and strings**
- **Even More Pointers, arrays and strings**
- **Recursion**
- **Static Libraries**
- **argc, argv**
- **malloc, free**
- **More malloc, free**
- **Structures, typedef**
- **Preprocessor**
- **Function pointers**
- **Variadic functions**
- **Bit manipulation**
- **File I/O**
- **Dynamic libraries**
- **Singly linked lists**
- **More singly linked lists**
- **Doubly linked lists**
- **Hash tables**
